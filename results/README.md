# Evaluation Results

This directory stores evaluation results for all submissions.

Each submission generates a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "student": "username",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-03T10:30:00.000000",
  "predator_score": 45.678,
  "num_episodes": 500
}
```

## Fields

- **success**: Whether evaluation completed successfully
- **student**: GitHub username of the submitter
- **timestamp**: ISO format timestamp of evaluation
- **predator_score**: Average reward over all episodes (student predator vs reference prey)
- **num_episodes**: Number of episodes evaluated (default: 500)

## Files

- `<username>_<timestamp>.json` - Individual evaluation results
- `latest_evaluation.json` - Most recent evaluation (temporary, not used for leaderboard)

## Notes

- Results are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow
- The leaderboard shows only the **best score** for each student
- Evaluation uses deterministic seeding per episode for reproducibility
- Old submissions are kept for historical tracking
- If a student resubmits, a new file is created with a new timestamp
- Students train predators; evaluation is against a public reference prey model
